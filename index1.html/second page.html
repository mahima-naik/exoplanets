        <h2 id="what-is-exoplanet">What is an Exoplanet?</h2>
        <p>An exoplanet is a planet that exists outside our solar system. They orbit stars other than the Sun and provide valuable information about planetary systems beyond our own.</p>

        <h2 id="discovery-exoplanets">How Exoplanets are Discovered</h2>
        <p>Most of the exoplanets discovered so far are in a relatively small region of our galaxy, the Milky Way. ("Small" meaning within thousands of light-years of our solar system; one light-year equals 5.88 trillion miles, or 9.46 trillion kilometers.) That is as far as current telescopes have been able to probe. We know from NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope that there are more planets than stars in the galaxy.</p>
        <p>Exoplanets are discovered using various techniques such as the transit method, radial velocity, direct imaging, and more. Each method provides unique insights into the characteristics of these distant worlds.</p>

        <h2>Exploration of Exoplanets</h2>
        <p>Exoplanets are explored using telescopes and space missions like NASA's Kepler and TESS. These missions have revolutionized our understanding of the universe by identifying potential habitable planets beyond our solar system.</p>

        <h2 id="types-exoplanets">Types of Exoplanets</h2>
        <p>Exoplanets come in many forms. Some are gas giants, while others are rocky planets. They can be hot or cold, and some may even have conditions suitable for life.</p>
        <p>Size and mass play a crucial role in determining planet types. There are also varieties within the size/mass classifications. Scientists have also noted what seems to be a strange gap in planet sizes. It’s been dubbed the “radius valley,” or the Fulton gap, after Benjamin Fulton, lead author on a paper describing it. Data from NASA’s Kepler spacecraft showed that planets of a certain size-range are rare – those between 1.5 and 2 times the size (diameter) of Earth, which would place them among the super-Earths. It’s possible that this represents a critical size in planet formation: Planets that reach this size quickly attract thick atmospheres of hydrogen and helium gas and balloon up into gaseous planets, while planets smaller than this limit are not large enough to hold such an atmosphere and remain primarily rocky, terrestrial bodies. On the other hand, the smaller planets that orbit close to their stars could be the cores of Neptune-like worlds that had their atmospheres stripped away.</p>

        <p>As of today, thousands of exoplanets have been discovered, providing scientists with data to study how planetary systems evolve. The exact number is continuously updated as new discoveries are made.</p>
