        <h1>Types of Exoplanets</h1>

        <!-- Gas Giants Section -->
        <div class="planet-section">
            <h2>Gas Giants</h2>
            <p>A gas giant is a large planet mostly composed of helium and/or hydrogen. These planets, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system, don’t have hard surfaces and instead have swirling gases above a solid core. Gas giant exoplanets can be much larger than Jupiter, and much closer to their stars than anything found in our solar system.</p>
            <p>For most of human history our understanding of how planets form and evolve was based on the eight planets in our solar system. But over the last 25 years, the discovery of more than 5,600 exoplanets, or planets outside our solar system, changed all that.</p>
            <p>Gas giants, like Jupiter or Saturn in our solar system, are composed mostly of helium and/or hydrogen. Gas giants nearer to their stars are often called “hot Jupiters.” More variety is hidden within these broad categories. Hot Jupiters, for instance, were among the first exoplanet types found – gas giants like Jupiter, yes, but orbiting so close to their stars that their temperatures soar into the thousands of degrees (Fahrenheit or Celsius). These large planets make such tight orbits that they cause a pronounced “wobble” in their stars, tugging their stellar hosts this way and that, and causing a measurable shift in the spectrum of light from the stars. That made hot Jupiters easier to detect in the early days of planet hunting using the radial velocity method.</p>
            <p>Similar in size to Jupiter, these gas-dominated planets orbit extremely close to their parent stars, circling them in as few as 18 hours. We have nothing like them in our own solar system, where the closest planets to the Sun are rocky and orbiting much farther away. The questions about hot Jupiters are as big as the planets themselves: Do they form close to their stars or farther away before migrating inward? And if these giants do migrate, what would that reveal about the history of the planets in our own solar system?</p>
            <p>To answer those questions, scientists will need to observe many of these hot giants very early in their formation. The detection of the exoplanet HIP 67522 b, thought to be the youngest hot Jupiter ever found (in June 2020), could expand our understanding. It orbits a well-studied star that is about 17 million years old, meaning the hot Jupiter is likely only a few million years younger, whereas most known hot Jupiters are more than a billion years old. The planet takes about seven days to orbit its star, which has a mass similar to the Sun's. Located only about 490 light-years from Earth, HIP 67522 b is about 10 times the diameter of Earth, or close to that of Jupiter. Its size strongly indicates that it is a gas-dominated planet.</p>

        <!-- Neptunian Planets Section -->
        <div class="planet-section">
            <h2>Neptunian Planets</h2>
            <p>Neptunian exoplanets are similar in size to Neptune or Uranus in our solar system. Neptunian planets typically have hydrogen and helium-dominated atmospheres with cores of rock and heavier metals.</p>
            <p>Neptunian exoplanets are similar in size to Neptune or Uranus in our solar system. (Neptune is about four times the size, or radius, of Earth and almost 17 times its mass, or weight.) Neptunian exoplanets may have a mixture of interiors though all would be rocky with heavier metals at their cores. Neptunian planets typically have hydrogen- and helium-dominated atmospheres. We’re also discovering mini-Neptunes, planets smaller than Neptune and bigger than Earth. No planets like these exist in our solar system.</p>
            <p>While Uranus and Neptune are mostly composed of hydrogen and helium, both also contain water, ammonia, and methane. Since these three chemicals are typically found frozen as ices in the cold outer solar system, Uranus and Neptune are often referred to as "ice giants" (though their interiors are warm enough that the "ices" inside them are not frozen). Researchers discovered an ice giant exoplanet 25,000 light-years away in 2014. We don’t know much about its composition, what it’s made of, or what elements are present in its atmosphere, but it’s in a similar orbit to its star as Uranus is to our Sun.</p>
            <p>It can be hard to tell a lot about distant planets’ compositions. Space telescopes like NASA’s Hubble (and formerly Spitzer) glean information about planet atmospheres by analyzing starlight. As starlight passes through a planet's atmosphere, atoms and molecules absorb light at certain wavelengths, blocking it from the telescope's view. The more light a planet blocks, the larger the planet appears. By analyzing the amount of light blocked by the planet at different wavelengths, called spectroscopy, researchers can determine which molecules make up the atmosphere. NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is designed to discover planets smaller than Neptune that transit stars bright enough to enable follow-up spectroscopic observations that can provide atmospheric compositions.</p>
            <p>Neptunian exoplanets often have thick clouds that block any light from coming through, hiding the signature of the molecules in the atmosphere. The James Webb Space Telescope, launched in 2021, is getting our best looks yet at exoplanet atmospheres.</p>

        <!-- Super-Earth Section -->
        <div class="planet-section">
            <h2>Super-Earth</h2>
            <p>Super-Earths – a class of planets unlike any in our solar system – are more massive than Earth yet lighter than ice giants like Neptune and Uranus, and can be made of gas, rock or a combination of both. They are between twice the size of Earth and up to 10 times its mass.</p>
            <p>Super-Earth is a reference only to an exoplanet’s size – larger than Earth and smaller than Neptune – but not suggesting they are necessarily similar to our home planet. The true nature of these planets remains shrouded in uncertainty because we have nothing like them in our own solar system – and yet, they are common among planets found so far in our galaxy.</p>
            <p>Over the last three decades, we have discovered all kinds of strange planets we never knew existed and that have no analog in our solar system. Super-Earths can be up to 10 times more massive than Earth. We don’t yet know enough about these planets to tell at what point they might lose a rocky surface. But in the range of 3-10 times the mass of Earth, there might be a wide variety of planetary compositions, including water worlds, snowball planets, or planets that, like Neptune, are composed largely of dense gas. Exoplanets at the upper limits of the super-Earth size limit can also be referred to as sub-Neptunes, or mini-Neptunes.</p>

        <!-- Terrestrial Planets Section -->
        <div class="planet-section">
            <h2>Terrestrial Planets</h2>
            <p>In our solar system, Earth, Mars, Mercury and Venus are terrestrial, or rocky, planets. For planets outside our solar system, those between half of Earth’s size to twice its radius are considered terrestrial and others may be even smaller.</p>
            <p>Terrestrial planets (Earth sized and smaller) are rocky worlds, composed of rock, silicate, water and/or carbon. To determine if some of these worlds have atmospheres, oceans or other signs of habitability, it takes more investigation. Larger terrestrial exoplanets (those at least twice as massive as Earth) are classified as super-Earths.</p>
            <p>In general, terrestrial planets have a bulk composition that is dominated by rock or iron, and a solid or liquid surface. These faraway worlds may have gaseous atmospheres, but that’s not a defining feature.

We've found rocky planets in Earth's size range, at the right distance from their parent stars to harbor liquid water (this is known as the habitable zone). While these characteristics don't guarantee a habitable world – we can't quite tell yet if these planets really do possess atmospheres or oceans – they can help point us in the right direction.</p>
